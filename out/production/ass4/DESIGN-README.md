# Design changes from previous iteration of the project. 

### View Changes
**No changes in the package structure.** 

We have just added menu classes to support the flexible portfolios. 


### Model Changes
1. In `AbstractPortfolio`, Instead of storing a map of `Details` object of each stock, we now store `Log` object of each stock. 



### Controller Changes


# Design of the current project


## The design of the program is divided into 3 segments, namely, model, view, and controller.

### View
*The view is what the end user of the program interacts with.
It includes displaying the menu or any text based outputs produced by the application along with
accepting requests from the user's choice in the form of an input.
It is also responsible for displaying the resultant data as per the request of the client.
It also the accepts csv file path and sends it to the controller to process the portfolio
content present in them.*

Every aspect of code related to the view segment is in the `view` package.
The structure of the view in the project folder is as follows:

1. `Menu` (Interface) that states the methods to be implemented by any class that extends
   the Menu class. The method signatures in it lists the functions that are going to be used to
   display the menu to the user.

2. `AbstractMenu` (abstract class) that will be used for providing views that will be
   common to other menu classes. This is done because in the future we may include menu for
   crypto/mutual fund portfolio which will share common methods.

3. `StockMenuInflexible` (concrete class) is meant to specifically deal with menu while interacting with
   user about inflexible stock portfolio.

4. `StockMenuFlexible` (concrete class) is meant to specifically deal with menu while interacting with
   user about flexible stock portfolio.

5. `MainMenu` interface that state the methods to be implemented in classes that implement it.

6. `MainMenuImpl` which can be used for choosing either to work with `Flexible` or `Inflexible`.


### Model
*The model is where the actual crux of codeâ€™s working lies. It is responsible for creation of
data to be saved in the portfolio object. It dictates the working of API which are going to be
used to fetch pertinent data relating to a particular stock. It lays down the skeleton for the
Portfolio object that we use to store all the relevant data relating to the portfolio created
by the user.*

Every aspect of code related to the view segment is in the `models` package.
The structure of the model in the project folder is as follows:

1. `api` package which contains:
   - `ShareAPI` (Interface) to get details about any type of share as and when requested by the
     user. We use it so that the program is open for extensions in the future. In later updates
     of the program, it may be required to include a portfolio for crypto, mutual funds, etc.,
     thus requiring the possible usage of multiple third party APIs.

   - `AlphaVantage` (Class) uses the AlphaVantage API to fetch data of any stock requested by
     the client to be added to their portfolio.

   - `StockAPI` A class that checks if a ticker symbol is supported by our program.
     If yes, then fetch the necessary data as per the users request.

   - `supported_stocs` directory, that contains all the stocks that are supported by the program.
     This directory stores the csv files of individual stock's data. This is done to make the
     application independent of any third party api. These are the only stocks accessible by the `StockAPI`

2. `portfolio` package which contains:
   - `Portfolio` (Interface) that states the methods that are expected from any kind of portfolio.
     We make this an interface so that it is scalable for future upgrades. For instance, we may be
     required to implement crypto, forex, or any other king of portfolio. The portfolio supports 
     addition of fractional shares, but the controller decides whether to allow whole or  
     fractional shares

   - `StockPortfolioInflexible` (Class) that is an extension of Portfolio class. This class specifically
     deals with the portfolio that stores shares supported by our program. 

   - `StockPortfolioFlexible` (Class) that is an extension of Portfolio class. This class specifically
     deals with the portfolio that stores shares supported out APIs. This type of portfolio has the ability to sell stocks, store cost basis,
     and get the performance of the portfolio over a time period. 

   - `Txn` (Enum)  to restrict types of transactions to only Buy or Sell. In the future, the transaction types like
     lending, borrowing could be accommodated if required.

3. `Details` (Class) that stores the quantity and the date of purchase of a particular share.

4. `Log` (Class) that stores the `Details` and `lastSoldDate` of a particular share in the portfolio.

### Controller

*The controller is the part of the program that has been designed to act as a delegator
between the model and the client. It tells the view how to interact with the client (as in
what kind of menu and choices to be provided to the client). It also makes sure that the
input from the users are valid by performing necessary validation checks. It then sends the
input form the user to the model for processing of the data. Finally, it gets the response from the
model and relays it to the view to be shown to the client.*


Every aspect of code related to the view segment is in the `controller` package.
The structure of the controller in the project folder is as follows:

1. `Controller` (Interface) An interface that state all the methods that are supposed to be
   implemented by all controllers of the program. A `Controller` object is meant to be
   used to produce a view to the client, take requests from them, perform data manipulations/cleanup
   on the inputs and delegate necessary functionality to the model of the program.

2. `AbstractController` (abstract class) An abstract controller that implements methods that
   are supposed to be common between multiple types of controllers across the program.

3. `StockController` (concrete class) The StockController implements methods that are meant to
   be executed while working specifically for stock related data and `stockAPI`. It also consists of
   methods for creating stock portfolios.

4. `Function` (enum) states the feature to be executed by the program.
